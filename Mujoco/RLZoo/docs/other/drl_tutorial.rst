Different from RLzoo for simple usage with **high-level APIs**, the `RL tutorial <https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/edit/master/examples/reinforcement_learning>`__ aims to make the reinforcement learning tutorial simple, transparent and straight-forward with **low-level APIs**, as this would not only benefits new learners of reinforcement learning, but also provide convenience for senior researchers to testify their new ideas quickly.
